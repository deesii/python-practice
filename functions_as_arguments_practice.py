#excercise II - Weather report


# Here are some instructions:

# Declare a function called report_weather that takes a temperature and a function as its two arguments
# Declare two other functions, each of which takes a temperature as an argument
# One is called as_sun_lover and it returns 'great' if the temp is 25 Celsius, or above. Otherwise it returns 'not great'
# One is called as_snow_lover and it returns 'great' if the temp is 0, or below. Otherwise it returns 'not great'
# Combine the functions to generate customised weather reports
